       "'WHAT IS EARS?The Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) is a mechanism to gently constrain textual requirements. The EARS patterns provide structured guidance that enable authors to write high quality textual requirements.There is a set syntax (structure), with an underlying ruleset. A small number of keywords are used to denote the different clauses of an EARS requirement. The clauses are always in the same order, following temporal logic. The syntax and the keywords closely match common usage of English and are therefore intuitive.HOW WAS EARS DEVELOPED?Mav and colleagues at Rolls-Royce PLC developed EARS whilst analysing the airworthiness regulations for a jet engine’s control system. The regulations contained high level objectives, a mixture of implicit and explicit requirements at different levels, lists, guidelines and supporting information.\\nIn the process of extracting and simplifying the requirements, Mav noticed that the requirements all followed a similar structure. He found that requirements were easiest to read when the clauses always appeared in the same order. These patterns were refined and evolved to create EARS.\\n\\nThe notation was first published in 2009 and has been adopted by many organisations across the world.\\n\\nWHY USE EARS?\\nSystem requirements are usually written in unconstrained natural language (NL), which is inherently imprecise. Often, requirements authors are not trained in how to write requirements. During system development, requirements problems propagate to lower levels. This creates unnecessary volatility and risk, impacting programme schedule and cost.\\n\\nEARS reduces or even eliminates common problems found in natural language requirements. It is especially effective for requirements authors who must write requirements in English, but whose first language is not English. EARS has proved popular with practitioners because it is lightweight, there is little training overhead, no specialist tool is necessary, and the resultant requirements are easy to read.\\n\\nWHO USES EARS?\\nEARS is used worldwide by large and small organisations in different domains. These include blue chip companies such as Airbus, Bosch,  Dyson, Honeywell, Intel, NASA, Rolls-Royce and Siemens.\\n\\nThe notation is taught at universities around the world including in China, France, Germany, Sweden, UK and USA.\\n\\nTHE EARS PATTERNS\\nGeneric EARS syntax\\nThe clauses of a requirement written in EARS always appear in the same order. The basic structure of an EARS requirement is:\\n\\nWhile <optional pre-condition>, when <optional trigger>, the <system name> shall <system response>\\n\\nThe EARS ruleset states that a requirement must have: Zero or many preconditions; Zero or one trigger; One system name; One or many system responses.\\n\\nThe application of the EARS notation produces requirements in a small number of patterns, depending on the clauses that are used.
